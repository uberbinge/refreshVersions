At the same time, library vendors publish very modularized artifacts: On Android, the big fat support libraries are dead, and their replacement, AndroidX , contains more than 200 different dependencies, grouped in over 70 groups, each having its own version. (AndroidX is only a part of first-party dependencies for Android projects, and third party dependencies can add up.) On the server, many frameworks or library suites offer a high number of artifacts. That applies to Ktor, Spring, http4k and others. Again, that\u2019s not even counting third party dependencies. Both trends come with great technical benefits. However, they also make it much more tedious to find where to add and update your dependencies in all those build.gradle[.kts] files! We saw this make developers update the dependencies less and less often, effectively leading to legacy accumulation (a form of technical debt), or even projects abandon. Yes, that\u2019s sad. Can we have our cake and eat it? We firmly believe that yes, we can have the benefits of modularization without the hell of dependency management . So what does gradle refreshVersions ? Centralize your dependencies in a proper file format \u00b6 Everyone who uses Gradle in a multi-modules environment has looked for a way to centralize all dependencies in one place. And there are solutions for that. Too many solutions in fact. Some put their versions in a variable val retrofitVersion = 2.9.0 , others in rootproject.ext , others in a libraries.gradle file, others still in buildSrc/src/main/Versions.kt , and the list goes on and on! A problem common to all those solutions is that they store the versions in a turing-complete programming language (Groovy or Kotlin). Then people try to hack together regular expressions to read or modify those files. We think this is wrong! Instead, gradle refreshVersions stores all the versions in one place in a proper file format: Java Properties, like gradle.properties . Just like npm\u2019s package.json , Maven\u2019s pom.xml , this file can be easily read and written by a computer program. Yes to better tooling! No Magic! \u00b6 You wonder how this works? No black magic involved, we leverage Gradle public APIs that are designed to edit declared dependencies ( Configuration.withDependencies , and PluginManagement.resolutionStrategy ), and we edit the versions constraints there. The rest is just a set of conventions. Consider the example below: Dependency notation Version key org.gradle:gradle-hello-world-plugin:_ version.org.gradle..gradle-hello-world-plugin com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:_ version.retrofit com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit-adapter-xxx:_ version.retrofit plugin with id \u201ccom.squareup.sqldelight\u201d plugin.com.squareup.sqldelight gradle refreshVersions works with an opt-in mechanism.

Look up for updates automatically \u00b6 With this infrastructure being in place, the major feature of gradle refreshVersions is like its name suggests: It will look up for all available updates of the dependencies used in the project.

Today we\u2019re introducing first-class support for it. To take advantage of it, you just need to add the dependency on platform(AndroidX.compose.bom) . Just like Firebase.bom , make sure you add it before any dependent dependency: dependencies { implementation(platform(AndroidX.compose.bom)) // Add this FIRST implementation(AndroidX.compose.material3) // Related dependencies AFTER implementation(AndroidX.compose.material3.windowSizeClass) // Same as above } In case you need to use a pre-release version (alpha, beta, rc\u2026), use the withVersionPlaceholder() function as such: dependencies { implementation(platform(AndroidX.compose.bom)) // Enables the BoM and depends on it implementation(AndroidX.compose.icons.extended) // Uses version defined in the BoM implementation(AndroidX.compose.material3.withVersionPlaceholder()) // Separate version in versions.properties } Fix StabilityLevel calculation for number-less pre-versions \u00b6 Since last changes in the Version class, versions like 1.7.20-RC and 1.7.20-Beta would be marked as stable instead of respectively ReleaseCandidate and Beta because the logic expected a number in all cases. The number is now optional for all pre-versions, except milestones. To prevent future recurrence of such regression, this commit also adds tests that assert the expected stability level of many known versions from various libraries. New dependency notations: \u00b6 Click to expand (11) - `AndroidX.asyncLayoutInflater.appcompat` - `AndroidX.compose.bom` - `AndroidX.dataStore.core.okio` - `AndroidX.graphics.core` - `AndroidX.input.motionPrediction` - `AndroidX.paging.testing` - `AndroidX.test.espresso.device` - `AndroidX.tv.foundation` - `AndroidX.tv.material` - `Firebase.dynamicModuleSupport` - `Google.firebase.dynamicModuleSupport` Version 0.50.2 (2022-09-24) \u00b6 Minor change \u00b6 Disable the old refreshVersionsDependenciesMapping and migrateToRefreshVersionsDependenciesConstants Gradle tasks. Fixes \u00b6 versionFor could not work as it should have if it was used in multiple modules with different values: the refreshVersions task would only display the updates of some of them, and mark the other ones as unused. This has been fixed. Running the refreshVersionsCleanup task would log that the gradle/libs.versions.toml file was modified even if it wasn\u2019t, and didn\u2019t exist in the first place. This is now fixed. Version ordering now recognizes random qualifiers instead of marking with an unknown stability level.

Jacob Kwitkoski Florian Levis Seokjae Lee solonovamax Louis CAD Jean-Michel Fayard Version 0.50.1 (2022-09-11) \u00b6 Fixes \u00b6 Fix the \u201cExtension of type \u2018VersionCatalogsExtension\u2019 does not exist.\u201d error. Versions Catalog migration only worked properly if you ran it twice. This has now been fixed! Version 0.50.0 (2022-09-09) \u00b6 Support for Versions Catalogs! \ud83c\udf89 \u00b6 Versions Catalogs are Gradle 7.4+ solution for storing dependencies and versions in a centralized file. Gradle will automatically recognize the gradle/libs.versions.toml file\u2026 and so will refreshVersions! It is similar in spirit to the versions.properties file, and we are happy to add support for it : ./gradlew refreshVersions will now add available updates as comments inside the gradle/libs.versions.toml file. ./gradlew refreshVersionsMigrate --mode=VersionCatalogAndVersionProperties will generate a versions catalog and migrate your build to use it if you don\u2019t have one already. Currently, we only support the default versions catalog. If you need support for multiple versions catalogs, add your \ud83d\udc4d on this issue . This is a big and new feature, so feel free to provide feedback in this thread , and report issues with the right info if there\u2019s no existing one here . Better support for versionFor , and Jetpack Compose! \u00b6 Before \u00b6 versionFor was helpful when you need to access a version located in the versions.properties file, but if there was no dependency using it, you\u2019d never see any updates. For projects/modules using Jetpack Compose from Google, that meant you\u2019d never see any updates for the compiler, and you\u2019d need to look it up yourself. Also, the version entry would be marked as unused, or would be the wrong one if you shared it with other Compose artifacts since the compiler now has its own versioning track . Now \u00b6 Now, passing a dependency notation such as AndroidX.compose.compiler to versionFor is exactly the same as if you used the dependency somewhere in the project: You\u2019ll get all the updates, and if the version is not yet specified in the versions.properties file, as usual, refreshVersions will try to find the latest most stable version available, plus it will also add the available comments for any newer, less stable version. That makes it even easier to start a project with Jetpack Compose! With this in a build.gradle.kts file: android { composeOptions { kotlinCompilerExtensionVersion = versionFor(AndroidX.compose.compiler) // Kotlin DSL kotlinCompilerExtensionVersion = versionFor(project, AndroidX.compose.compiler) // Groovy DSL } } AndroidX.compose.compiler is equivalent to \"androidx.compose.compiler:compiler:_\" . You\u2019ll get that in the versions.properties file if you were on version 1.3.0-rc01 : version.androidx.compose.compiler = 1.3.0-rc01 ## # available=1.3.0-rc02 ## # available=1.3.0 New page for all the built-in dependency notations \ud83d\udcd5 \u00b6 To make it easy to start new projects, new modules, or using a common library, we spent a lot of time adding built-in dependency notations for Kotlin, kotlinx, AndroidX, and more. However, it wasn\u2019t so easy to know that they exist. That\u2019s why we made a dedicated page where you can find them all ! Let us know how helpful it is to you! Fixes \u00b6 rejectVersionIf { \u2026 } had an issue: its removal would not be taken into account until the Gradle daemon would be killed. This now behaves correctly. We were ignoring repositories defined in pluginManagement { \u2026 } , which might have led to Gradle plugin updates being missed by refreshVersions. Now, we look up these repositories as well.

Version 0.40.2 (2022-06-01) \u00b6 Fixes \u00b6 Fix a memory leak that led the Gradle daemon to eventually suffer from a lot of GC overhead before running out of memory when a Gradle plugin had its version managed by refreshVersions. We\u2019ve done extensive tests to ensure we fixed this for good, and the CI now checks for leaks in the Gradle daemon to prevent future recurrence. Note that if you were using Gradle configuration cache, you were likely to encounter this issue less often. Fix the AndroidX.wear.tiles.material dependency notation that was pointing to wrong coordinates because of a typo. The test that was designed to catch this has been fixed to prevent future recurrence. Thanks to @yacine-ser for raising this memory leak issue along with a hint on the culprit, it was very helpful in reproducing and fixing the leak. New dependency notations: \u00b6 AndroidX.camera.mlKitVision AndroidX.compose.material3.windowSizeClass AndroidX.compose.ui.text.googleFonts AndroidX.core.performance AndroidX.customView.poolingContainer AndroidX.health.connectClient AndroidX.metrics.performance AndroidX.test.ext.junit.gTest AndroidX.test.ext.junit.ktx (was previously AndroidX.test.ext.junitKtx) AndroidX.wear.watchFace.complications.rendering Google.android.material.composeThemeAdapter3 Version 0.40.1 (2022-02-06) \u00b6 Fixes \u00b6 Improved support of Gradle configuration cache. In the previous release, if you ran the refreshVersions task twice in a row with configuration cache enabled, the second run would fail, even in warning mode. It\u2019s now fixed. To make refreshVersions compatible with GCS (Google Cloud Storage) hosted maven repositories (which can be helpful for company/team internal libraries), we were using the official library from Google. Unfortunately, this led to dependency hell to some of our users because it then requires a specific version of Guava, which could be different from the one required by other plugins, and the one from refreshVersions would prevail. So, to resolve these problems, we replaced our implementation with one that reuses Gradle\u2019s built-in GcsClient , and we\u2019re very happy with that because it also has the benefit of reducing the total size of refreshVersions when we include its dependencies. Note that this is using internal Gradle APIs, but we\u2019ve seen that they didn\u2019t change in 5 years, and the code path is executed only if you have gcs backed repositories in your project.

Version 0.40.0 (2022-01-24) \u00b6 New features \u00b6 We are very happy to announce that refreshVersions now supports Gradle configuration cache ! Gradle configuration is all about saving time, which is also the mission of refreshVersions, albeit in a different situation, so it made a lot of sense to not step on that feature Gradle engineers worked hard on. Note that the refreshVersions task itself is not compatible with configuration cache because it\u2019s impossible with the current Gradle APIs. Error tolerance : The refreshVersions task will no longer fail if there\u2019s a problem getting versions from a repository. Now, it will add contextual comments in the versions.properties file, so you know what failed, and don\u2019t get fully blocked next time jcenter or another repository undergoes an outage. This should also help if you\u2019re running the refreshVersions task through an unstable internet connection and some network calls fail because of that.

Version 0.30.2 (2022-01-09) \u00b6 Bug fixes \u00b6 We are now shutting down the thread-pool from kotlinx.coroutines that we\u2019re using when the build finishes ( Dispatchers.shutdown() ). We believe it caused memory leaks in the Gradle Daemon, and this change, made possible since kotlinx.coroutines 1.6.0 should fix the last memory leak cause. The versions of dependencies from the androidx.test family started diverging, so we changed replaced the version.androidx.test version key with more specific ones. The migration will be done automatically on upgrade of refreshVersions, without upgrading the versions of androidx.tests dependencies themselves. New feature \u00b6 We now support fetching updates on plain-text http repositories. We evaluated the security risks, and for the case of refreshVersions itself, there is none that is significant (the worst possibility is crashing the build under attack), and if you\u2019re not using plain-text http repositories in the first place in your project, this doesn\u2019t apply at all anyway. We added support for this because some of our users need it for local maven repositories.

Version 0.30.1 (2021-12-21) \u00b6 Bug fixes \u00b6 Fix Gradle sync for projects using buildSrc ( #474 ) Support buildSrc modules that have no plugin declared Version 0.30.0 (2021-12-19) \u00b6 Potentially breaking change \u00b6 We raised the minimum supported Gradle version to 6.8, because we started to use Kotlin 1.4 features, and Gradle pins the stdlib version. Since at the time of writing, the latest Gradle version is 7.3, we believe it won\u2019t actually block any of our users. We have a short section about updating Gradle on our website here , feel free to check it out if it can help you. New features \u00b6 Repositories declared in dependencyResolutionManagement are now supported (Gradle 7+) \u00b6 Since Gradle 7, you can declare repositories of the entire Gradle project (including all subprojects and their buildscript) in the dependencyResolutionManagement block in the settings.gradle[.kts] file. Unfortunately, refreshVersions didn\u2019t support it, so, unless you also kept repositories declared with allprojects , or per project, you would end up with all version entries in the versions.properties file marked as unused after running the refreshVersions task, and you\u2019d not see the newer updates. This release resolves this issue, and we are eager to use it in our projects ourselves. Update on built-in dependency notations \u00b6 Sometimes, libraries get deprecated, or the maintainers change the maven coordinates. When it happens, this fact is unfortunately not included in the maven-metadata.xml files, or any other standard metadata. That means tools like refreshVersions will believe you\u2019re on the latest versions, when you\u2019re not, because it lacks the necessary information. One example is Google that changed the maven coordinates of all their AndroidX Wear Watchface artifacts several weeks ago. It took us time to catch-up with this change because we wanted to design a generic mechanism for this recurrent problem, and provide the best experience for you, and ourselves. From now on, we have the ability to remove old or deprecated built-in dependency notations in refreshVersions, and doing so will not break your builds, nor will it change the dependencies of your project. However, it\u2019ll help you notice the deprecation, and it\u2019ll help you switch to the replacement dependencies, if any. The way it works is that we keep a versioned list of all the removals, and on refreshVersions upgrade, an automatic replacement will put back the hardcoded maven coordinates, using the version placeholder, and it will add our handwritten TODO/FIXME comments, along with a perfectly aligned replacement suggestion if there is any, so that moving to the newer artifact is as easy as upgrading to a newer version in the versions.properties file. We designed the system so that it cannot break your build, even if you were using withVersion(\u2026) or other DependencyNotation extensions, even if you have code comments or special string literals. It also supports the case where we just move a dependency notation to another place, or change its name, without changing the maven coordinates. Because of this change, it\u2019s important that you check the git diff after upgrading refreshVersions and running the first Gradle reload/sync/build, so you can see if there\u2019s been any changes, and if you might want to switch to any replacement dependencies. This change will enable us to keep the built-in dependency notations updated with less effort, so we\u2019re very happy to have it ready, and fully tested. We\u2019ve already started to take advantage of it to clean up all the discontinued artifacts we found in AndroidX. Bug fixes \u00b6 Repositories declared in the dependencyResolutionManagement block were ignored. Now, they are taken into account. The kotest extensions dependencies were previously wrongly sharing their version as per refreshVersions rules. Now, they each have their independent, own version key. The refreshVersionsMigrate task wasn\u2019t inserting new entries in alphabetical order. Now it is. The refreshVersionsMigrate task wasn\u2019t migrating buildscript dependencies. Now it is.

Version 0.23.0 (2021-09-28) \u00b6 Bug fix \u00b6 Fix a bug that broke standalone buildSrc builds. Version 0.22.0 (2021-09-27) \u00b6 Bug fix \u00b6 Fix a regression that brought a KotlinNullPointerException in the build. We apologize for the issue. Thanks to Marcin and Craig for the report . New dependency notations: \u00b6 AndroidX.compose.ui.toolingPreview Chucker KotlinX.cli KotlinX.datetime Thanks to Filip Czaplicki , who contributed to the new dependency notations! Version 0.21.0 (2021-09-07) \u00b6 New feature \u00b6 We now support npm dependencies for Kotlin/JS! Just put the version placeholder ( _ ) in place of the version, and you\u2019re good to go. The version keys follow a simple naming scheme where their id is prefixed with npm , here are two examples: - version.npm.react=17.0.2 - version.npm.@googlemaps/js-api-loader=1.12.2 Special thanks to NikkyAI who authored the feature, and pair-programmed with us to refine it! Improvements \u00b6 Before this release, when we added new dependency notations and shorter version keys, it could lead to an unwanted upgrade of the dependency in the project upgrading refreshVersions. With this release, we make sure to copy the same version if we add or change the version key, and it will also work if we decide to remove one. This ensures that upgrading refreshVersions will not be able to affect your application or library. Thanks to Brady Aiello from Touchlab for helping out via pair-programming! New dependency notations: \u00b6 Koin (new group with several dependencies) Touchlab.stately (new group with several dependencies) RussHWolf.multiplatformSettings (new group with several dependencies) Thanks to Brady Aiello again, who contributed to these new dependency notations! Version 0.20.0 (2021-08-23) \u00b6 Announcement \u00b6 We are now ready to accept dependency notation contributions for high-quality and popular dependencies from the Kotlin ecosystem! Look for issues with the Dependency notations and up-for-grabs tags to find one you can directly contribute to, or submit a new issue to ask for a new one to be added. We updated the contributing guide on the website, it now has a guide dedicated to it here . New features \u00b6 refreshVersions will now add ## unused comments on top of unused entries in the versions.properties file after you run the refreshVersions task, so you know which ones are obsolete and can be removed. The new rejectVersionsIf { \u2026 } predicate available in the refreshVersions { \u2026 } extension in your settings.gradle[.kts] file will allow you to filter any kind of versions you don\u2019t want to know about. It can be handy to filter snapshots out for example. Most of our dependency notations now provide more flexibility with 3 new extension functions: withVersionPlaceholder() , withVersion(\u2026) , and withoutVersion() . Change (potentially breaking) \u00b6 If you use a BoM from the built-in dependency notations, it must always appear before dependencies from the group it controls, or you\u2019ll see an error message that will fail the Gradle build. We do this because we can\u2019t switch on usage of the BoM for linked dependencies that have already been evaluated by Gradle. Improvements \u00b6 The refreshVersionsMigrate will now use the built-in dependency notations if they match existing dependencies.

AGP, the Android Gradle Plugin). To avoid this inconvenience, running the refreshVersions task will now automatically check if it\u2019s running on an Android project, and in such cases, will edit (safely) the lint.xml file, creating it if needed, and add the needed rules to have these specific warnings and errors ignored. Fixes \u00b6 Add missing version placeholder ( _ ) for the Google.android.material.composeThemeAdapter dependency notation. Fix a bug that prevented from using the correct version of org.jetbrains.kotlinx.benchmark and any other Gradle plugin with an id starting with org.jetbrains.kotlinx because it matched over org.jetbrains.kotlin as well. We are now matching on org.jetbrains.kotlin. to avoid this issue. New dependency notations: \u00b6 AndroidX: emoji2 views-helper views health.servicesClient security.appAuthenticatorTesting Google.accompanist.insets.ui Version 0.10.0 (2021-05-13) \u00b6 New features \u00b6 There\u2019s a new versionFor function that takes a dependency notation, or a version key, and returns the corresponding version that is in the versions.properties file. For example, if you use Jetpack Compose, you can leverage it to set kotlinCompilerExtensionVersion with versionFor(AndroidX.compose.ui) . Groovy DSL users can find it in the Versions class. Support updates of settings plugins in settings.gradle.kts and settings.gradle files (including refreshVersions itself). Support getting versions from Google Cloud Storage backed repositories . This can be helpful if you need to update private artifacts hosted there. Thanks to NikkyAI for the contribution! Changes \u00b6 Setting up refreshVersions has been significantly simplified: Now, it\u2019s simply a plugin that must be applied in the settings.gradle.kts or settings.gradle file. Note that if you want to apply it to buildSrc as well, there\u2019s a gotcha regarding defining the version. The best thing is that on upgrade, refreshVersions will automatically replace the old & verbose bootstrap with the new plugin setup , and that works for buildSrc special case as well. We made many tests to ensure that this logic is reliable, doesn\u2019t break any code, doesn\u2019t remove important comments, and doesn\u2019t affect custom configuration in any way. Bintray sunset resiliency: If refreshVersions encounters an HTTP 403 response on a bintray repository or on jcenter, it will consider the artifact to not be in this repository instead of crashing (but you can/should still remove bintray repo declarations anyway since it has been sunset). Missing short version key rules have been added for many dependency notations groups in the Testing object, and for Orchid . Potentially breaking changes \u00b6 The fix of the Square.sqlDelight.coroutinesExtensions dependency notation can lead to such an error: Failed to resolve: coroutines-extensions-1.4.4-_ . If you get a similar error on upgrade, it\u2019s because you applied a fix like that one: Square.sqlDelight.coroutinesExtensions + \":_\" . You now can (must) remove it. A bunch of new version key rules have been added, which means you might have changes of version keys, and because we currently don\u2019t have a migration facility for those, it might cause unwanted upgrades. Consequently, especially for Android projects, we recommend checking/verifying the changes made by refreshVersions after the first Gradle sync/reload/build that follows the upgrade. Fixes \u00b6 Authentication for maven repositories should now work correctly. Should, because it can only work using internal Gradle APIs for the time being (though there\u2019s a safeguard to not crash if the API changes). Thanks to Mayank Kharbanda for the PR! Custom extraArtifactVersionKeyRules could not be taken into account if there was an overlapping rule already present in refreshVersions, even if it was more specific. That ordering issue has now been fixed, the most specific rule will now always be the one applied. If you had issues with some recent AndroidX artifacts, and their version key, they should all be fixed now, and there\u2019s all the latest dependency notations.

We\u2019re very grateful for your time and help, and we think our users will be as well. \ud83d\ude4f Also, thanks to all the folks that reported issues. It was very helpful to prioritize on our side. Version 0.9.7 (2020-10-16) \u00b6 Fixes \u00b6 Running the refreshVersions task twice or more would fail with \u201cexecutor rejected\u201d as an error message, until the Gradle daemon is killed. This has now been fixed. (Issue #263) The refreshVersions task was failing after the latest Gradle release candidate was superseded by the stable release because the API would return an empty JSON object after this, which we didn\u2019t expect. (Minor) We fixed a typo in a diagnostic task name ( refreshVersionsDependenciesMapping ) Version 0.9.6 (2020-10-12) \u00b6 Fixes \u00b6 This release fixes a major memory leak that would make Gradle Daemons unusable after several builds (or Gradle syncs/imports). We are very sorry for that issue, and the annoyance it might have caused. We experienced it too as users, and that\u2019s why we are bringing the fix now. We took the necessary measures to avoid future recurrence of such memory leaks. Fix of a bug that\u2019d make the first Gradle sync after adding a dependency fail. Breaking change \u00b6 If you were using Jetpack Compose, the compiler dependency had its maven coordinates changed in version 1.0.0-alpha04. We updated the AndroidX.compose.compiler dependency notation, which means it now works only for Compose 1.0.0-alpha04 and more future versions. New dependency notations \u00b6 Google.android.playServices.mlKit Google.mlKit KotlinX.serialization.json Deprecated \u00b6 Firebase ML Kit has been rebranded to Google ML Kit along with API and feature changes since 2020-08-14 update , so we deprecated the Firebase.mlKit dependencies and introduced new ones in Google.android.playServices.mlKit and Google.mlKit . New features \u00b6 refreshVersions will now warn you when Gradle is not up-to-date, and will give you the commands to run to update it for you to copy/paste and run. It works if you\u2019re using a release candidate, and also if you\u2019re using a nightly version! Version 0.9.5 (2020-08-21) \u00b6 This is a major release that brings surface-level and internal changes, paving the way for the upcoming 1.0 release. The plugin setup/bootstrap has changed , so check out the updated documentation in Setup . New features \u00b6 Self update discovery. RefreshVersions will check for its own updates , and add available comments in the settings.gradle[.kts] file if needed for easy upgrade. This allows you to get future improvements conveniently. Support for buildscript dependencies. It now works just like regular dependencies. First class support for buildSrc Support maven repositories with basic authentication (aka. credentials with username and password) Going forward, refreshVersions will be able to auto-migrate any breaking changes a new version would introduce in your versions.properties , build.gradle and build.gradle.kts files in. This version of refreshVersions integrates the facility to let future versions of refreshVersions that migration is needed, and from which version. This is a very important change that ensures you can keep your projects updated with the least effort possible.

If you were using one of the following, you\u2019ll need to migrate these usages. We recommend to use \u201cReplace in Path\u201d in IntelliJ or Android Studio, filtering for the *.gradle.kts or *.gradle file extensions to do these replacements with ease. Note that for future versions, refreshVersions will be able to do this automatically. Here\u2019s the list of renamed dependency notations: AndroidX.coreKtx -> AndroidX.core.ktx AndroidX.coreRole -> AndroidX.core.role Square.retrofit2.adapter.retrofitJava8 -> Square.retrofit2.adapter.java8 Square.retrofit2.adapter.retrofitRxJava1 -> Square.retrofit2.adapter.rxJava1 Square.retrofit2.adapter.retrofitRxJava2 -> Square.retrofit2.adapter.rxJava2 Testing.junit.junitJupiter -> Testing.junit Testing.mockK.mockK -> Testing.mockK Changes \u00b6 Make the refreshVersions task cancellable during network requests. Now, only http 404 and 401 responses from repositories will be silent. Server errors (i.e. all but http 404 and 401 responses) are now reported. Network failures are now reported. There is now a connection timeout (10 seconds per request for now) An error is reported if a dependency wasn\u2019t found in any of the configured repositories. All the searched repositories are now listed if a dependency wasn\u2019t found in any of them. Only declared repositories are now looked up. (Before, refreshVersions would search all dependencies in all repositories of all modules and their buildscript, regardless of which module was declaring them.) Dependency notation in Ktor no longer uses the native suffixed artifacts (because Kotlin 1.4 drops them, as the main ones become multiplatform) Fixes \u00b6 Version sorting would crash if a version had a long number in it. This has now been fixed, any length of digit sequence is now supported in versions. Fix maven coordinates of several dependency notations Don\u2019t crash on repositories that are not https or file or have non password credentials. The AndroidX.test.ext.jankTestHelper notation and few other ones in Firebase.mlKit had wrong maven coordinates. This has been fixed, and tests have been added to prevent it from happening again on any dependency notation we provide.

Unfortunately, this led to dependency hell to some of our users because it then requires a specific version of Guava, which could be different from the one required by other plugins, and the one from refreshVersions would prevail. So, to resolve these problems, we replaced our implementation with one that reuses Gradle\u2019s built-in GcsClient , and we\u2019re very happy with that because it also has the benefit of reducing the total size of refreshVersions when we include its dependencies.

When it happens, this fact is unfortunately not included in the maven-metadata.xml files, or any other standard metadata. That means tools like refreshVersions will believe you\u2019re on the latest versions, when you\u2019re not, because it lacks the necessary information. One example is Google that changed the maven coordinates of all their AndroidX Wear Watchface artifacts several weeks ago. It took us time to catch-up with this change because we wanted to design a generic mechanism for this recurrent problem, and provide the best experience for you, and ourselves. From now on, we have the ability to remove old or deprecated built-in dependency notations in refreshVersions, and doing so will not break your builds, nor will it change the dependencies of your project. However, it\u2019ll help you notice the deprecation, and it\u2019ll help you switch to the replacement dependencies, if any. The way it works is that we keep a versioned list of all the removals, and on refreshVersions upgrade, an automatic replacement will put back the hardcoded maven coordinates, using the version placeholder, and it will add our handwritten TODO/FIXME comments, along with a perfectly aligned replacement suggestion if there is any, so that moving to the newer artifact is as easy as upgrading to a newer version in the versions.properties file. We designed the system so that it cannot break your build, even if you were using withVersion(\u2026) or other DependencyNotation extensions, even if you have code comments or special string literals. It also supports the case where we just move a dependency notation to another place, or change its name, without changing the maven coordinates. Because of this change, it\u2019s important that you check the git diff after upgrading refreshVersions and running the first Gradle reload/sync/build, so you can see if there\u2019s been any changes, and if you might want to switch to any replacement dependencies. This change will enable us to keep the built-in dependency notations updated with less effort, so we\u2019re very happy to have it ready, and fully tested.

You can use them in any build.gradle or build.gradle.kts file. Here\u2019s an example of how it looks like in the IDE: No imports needed. Autocomplete in IDE for easy discoverability. You can see all the dependency objects in this directory . Wait, what version are those dependencies using? \u00b6 All these dependency notations specify their version as the version placeholder ( _ ), so refreshVersions can replace them seamlessly with the corresponding value defined in the versions.properties file, via Gradle APIs. The same will work for your own, non-built-in dependencies if you use that same version placeholder. After adding a dependency that doesn\u2019t have its version specified in the versions.properties file yet, refreshVersions will edit it and put the most stable recent version in it on the next Gradle sync (or any other Gradle run). It will also put any less stable versions as comments, allowing you to quickly upgrade if needed. Add Gradle plugins \u00b6 This section doesn\u2019t apply to plugins that are configured in a buildscript block (since these have their versions configured like regular dependencies), but only to those that are configured solely with a plugin id. To add such a plugin, do as usual, but do not specify the version in the build.gradle or build.gradle.kts file. Instead, set it up like so in the versions.properties file: versions.properties plugin.com.apollographql.apollo = 2.4.1 plugin.com.squareup.sqldelight = 1.4.3 Then you can omit the plugin version in all build.gradle(.kts) of your project: some-module/build.gradle.kts plugins { id ( \"com.squareup.sqldelight\" ) id ( \"com.apollographql.apollo\" ) } some-module/build.gradle plugins { id 'com.squareup.sqldelight' id 'com.apollographql.apollo' } As you see, the convention is pretty simple. The key is the id of the plugin, prefixed by plugin. : plugin.some.plugin.id sets the version of the plugin of id some.plugin.id . Get the version from anywhere \u00b6 In some cases, you might need to get the version defined in the versions.properties file in a Gradle script. For these cases, there\u2019s the versionFor function that takes either a version key, or a full dependency notation. Here\u2019s a usage example with Jetpack Compose in an Android project: build.gradle.kts build.gradle import de.fayard.refreshVersions.core.versionFor ... composeOptions { kotlinCompilerExtensionVersion = versionFor ( AndroidX . compose . ui ) } import static de . fayard . refreshVersions . core . Versions . versionFor ... composeOptions { kotlinCompilerExtensionVersion = versionFor ( AndroidX . compose . ui ) } Using versionFor(\"version.androidx.compose.ui\") would also work, so long as version.androidx.compose.ui is defined in the versions.properties file. Non-built-in dependency notations \u00b6 Generally speaking, so long as you have the version placeholder ( _ ) in place of the version, refreshVersions will handle it. Below are some ways to deal with the dependency notations that are not built-in. Using buildSrcLibs \u00b6 The Gradle task buildSrcLibs can be used to automatically generate a Libs.kt file in the buildSrc , that will contain all the dependency notations curently used in your build. To use it, you need to enable it: settings.gradle.kts settings.gradle plugins { // See https://jmfayard.github.io/refreshVersions id ( \"de.fayard.refreshVersions\" ) version \"0.51.0\" } refreshVersions { enableBuildSrcLibs () // <-- Add this } plugins { // See https://jmfayard.github.io/refreshVersions id 'de.fayard.refreshVersions' version '0.51.0' } refreshVersions { enableBuildSrcLibs () // <-- Add this } Then you can use the command ./gradlew buildSrcLibs to generate accessors for your dependencies $ ./gradlew buildSrcLibs > Task :buildSrcLibs new file: buildSrc/build.gradle.kts new file: buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/Libs.kt The generated file will look like this: buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/Libs.kt /** * Generated by `$ ./gradlew buildSrcLibs` */ object Libs { const val guava : String = \"com.google.guava:guava:_\" const val guice : String = \"com.google.inject:guice:_\" } Because this file uses the version placeholder ( _ ), it is compatible with refreshVersions! Read more: gradle buildSrcVersions . Using Package Search from JetBrains \u00b6 JetBrains offers the plugin Package Search , it is compatible with both IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio. It also has a website Package Search provides a nice UX to add a dependency: Can you use it with refreshVersions? Sure, just use the version placeholder ( _ ). Using Gradle 7+ Versions Catalogs \u00b6 Gradle 7 comes with its own feature for centralizing dependencies: Versions Catalogs . With Versions Catalog, you have a file like gradle/libs.versions.toml where you can centralize all your dependencies and benefit from typesafe accessors in your build.gradle[.kts] file. Since the feature is incubating, you need to enable it explicitly in the project\u2019s settings.gradle[.kts] file: enableFeaturePreview(\"VERSION_CATALOGS\") Does that work well with refreshVersions? Yes, as long as you use the version placeholder ( _ ). gradle/libs.versions.toml [libraries] accompanist-coil = \"com.google.accompanist:accompanist-coil:_\" accompanist-flowlayout = \"com.google.accompanist:accompanist-flowlayout:_\" accompanist-insets = \"com.google.accompanist:accompanist-insets:_\" ... In this configuration, the versions catalog centralizes the dependency notations, while refreshVersions takes care of setting and updating the versions. We have ideas to integrate Versions Catalogs deeper into refreshVersions, see this issue . Using the libraries.gradle pattern \u00b6 An older approach to centralize dependencies is to have a libraries.gradle file: libraries.gradle ext . libraries = [ // Groovy map literal spring_core: \"org.springframework:spring-core:3.1\" , junit: \"junit:junit:4.10\" ] some-module/build.gradle apply ( from = \"../libraries.gradle\" ) dependencies { compile libraries . spring_core testCompile libraries . junit } Does that work with refreshVersions too?
